# Which Dead by Daylight perk is this?

A website which lets you enter a description of a perk's icon using tags, and then lists all of the perks that match it, along with their descriptions. Useful for when you're watching a streamer/video.

# Isn't there already a Twitch extension for this?

Yes, but the streamer has to have it installed and it doesn't work on mobile or Youtube. I use this as a backup when the extension's unavailable.
